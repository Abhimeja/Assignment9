    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation occurs, Python creates an exception object that contains information about the error, such as its type and an optional error message. This exception object is then raised, or thrown, to indicate that an error has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are used to handle various types of errors and exceptional situations that can occur in a program, such as division by zero, accessing an invalid index in a list, or opening a file that doesn't exist. By using exception handling, you can catch these exceptions and gracefully handle them, rather than allowing the program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are errors that occur when you write code that does not follow the correct syntax or grammar of the programming language. Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed because the interpreter or compiler cannot understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an error or exceptional situation arises, while syntax errors occur during the parsing or compilation stage when the code is being translated into machine-readable instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms such as try-except blocks, allowing the program to recover from errors and continue execution. Syntax errors, on the other hand, must be fixed before the program can be executed because they indicate a fundamental problem with the code's syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Impact: Exceptions interrupt the normal flow of the program, but they can be handled and controlled, allowing the program to handle errors and continue executing. Syntax errors, however, prevent the program from being executed altogether until the errors are fixed."
